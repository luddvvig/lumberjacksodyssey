            <p>See. I told all of you this isn't just a hiking blog. It's about me, and my Odyssey! What that now means?
                I think, for now it has to involve Disc Golf. Or Frisbee Golf. Or as the cool kids call it "Frolf" (no
                it's disc golf)(please don't call it Frolf). I just love playing it.</p>

            <h3>How did a guy who hates walking pick this up?</h3>
            <p>Hard to say. I guess it's my brother's fault to begin with. He introduced me to it, and I immediately
                told him "wow what a ridiculous sport". Never gonna play, totally stupid. And then I played.</p>

            <p>I have been competing in different sports my whole life, and then, all of a sudden, I didn't. Going from
                always to never was liberating at first, and then I felt like I had lost something. So when I started to
                play disc golf with my brother I could compete again. And I can compete against myself anytime I want,
                there's always something I can do better. It's a sport of "you're never perfect". It also feels sooo
                good seeing a disc flying like I intended it to do.</p>

            <h3>Where I'm At Now</h3>
            <p>So that's what a lot of my spare time is. Playing. Training. Watching disc golf. I'm no good—but I'm
                improving. I just started playing actual competitions, and that's really fun as well. It's the lowest
                league in Sweden, and I'm in the lowest class, but it is competition. And I'd forgotten how much I
                enjoyed that.</p>

            <p>My goal for now is enjoying competing, tricking myself to walk outside and seeing as many courses as I
                can. For now. Until I can buy that Van and only play all day. Yeah that sounds like a Life!</p>
