            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>Hello world! I’m Lumberjack. Right now, I’m on what I call my Perpetual Odyssey. I’ve
                done some things in my life I want to share — and hopefully, there’s more to come! I’m from a small town
                in Sweden, and this is my life. Before all this, I tried other stuff too.
                I’ve lived a pretty normal life, just with the occasional strange detour. Maybe
                I’ll write about those one day too.</p>

            <p>So, why am I Lumberjack? Well, it’s my trail name. Easy as that. Plus, my teachers told me not to share
                my real name with strangers on the internet. So for now, for you, I’m Lumberjack.</p>

            <h3>How did I end up here?</h3>

            <p>This chapter of my life started with feeling lost. Studying to be a lawyer wasn’t what <i>Suits</i> and
                <i>Harvey Specter</i> made it out to be, and I started to realize that’s not what I wanted. So I quit
                school and tried to figure out what to do next. In search of something-anything-I stumbled upon the
                Pacific Crest Trail. For a broke student, it seemed like a great adventure, and off I went! That’s the
                short version of how I ended up at the top of the lower 48 states.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <h3>So, how did I end up here again?</h3>

            <p>After three months on the PCT, I found myself working with cross-country skiing and other sports. Not
                exactly the path of a deal-making, courtroom-clashing lawyer - but it felt more me. More Lumberjack. But
                after two years, the restlessness crept back in. So I left. Again. To hike the same trail, with the same
                start and the same dirt path. I loved the adventure. So... I must love hiking, right? People around me
                are amazed at my hiking skills and think I’ve walked every trail in my hometown or even my country.
                Well, no... I’ve never hiked a single mile just for fun outside of the PCT. In fact, I kinda hate it.
            </p>

            <h3>What do I like then?</h3>

            <p>I like to challenge myself - like walking far. I like adventure, competition, and new experiences. Oh,
                and I love disc golf. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot.</p>

            <p>So that’s probably what I’ll be writing about here. My past experiences on the PCT, how to hike it and
                have the most fun doing it (even though walking sucks). My journey as a disc golfer and my efforts to
                get better at a sport I recently started loving. And hopefully, new adventures along the way! This is
                the Perpetual Odyssey of Lumberjack. </p>
