            <h2>Lizards All The Way Down</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published: January 2026</p>

            <p>On my first walk through the desert, I learned something about Americans. They're all crazy.</p>

            <p>Now of course not all of them are, but I have never met crazy like this before.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>After a rough couple of days hiking with an injured calf, I gave up. Big surprise, I'm not a "purist".
                After stumbling into the Joshua Inn, I decided to skip a bit forward to heal my leg and wait up for my
                trail family.</p>

            <p>So as they walked on after some pool and a few beers, I stayed behind. And that's when I met the locals.
                Funny lot, that. As the beers flowed we talked about all kinds of things, like how to make rattlesnake
                soup. (something I'll never try). And I met this Lady who offered to take me to Wrightwood the next
                morning! She seemed so nice!</p>

            <h3>The Ride</h3>
            <p>So the next day, Lady came hungover as fuck to pick me up. Also hungover. And the ride started nice, we
                chatted about ourselves. Like one does with strangers. Easy, shallow, and don't say anything about
                politics or religion. You know, Swedish style small talk.</p>

            <p>Well that's what I did at least. Lady jumped straight to the no-no zone. Biden kills our country, JFK
                runs the country still and all kinds of stuff. Oh—and that the queen of England and the king of Sweden
                are all Lizards from outer space. Who knew?</p>

            <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
            <p>So what do you do in this situation? Well I didn't want to get booted out of the car, so I agreed. Of
                course. Probably the best thing to do?</p>

            <p>Well after a few hours of insanity we got to the right place. We said our goodbyes, I thanked her for
                teaching me so much I was totally unaware of, and then I offered gas money. Which she promptly refused.
                And then she drove straight back to the inn.</p>

            <p>Now I think Americans are some of the kindest people you can meet. Crazy? Yeah, some of them are. But
                they can still be kind. I didn't know that before.</p>
