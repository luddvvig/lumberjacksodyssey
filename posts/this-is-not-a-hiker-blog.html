                <p><strong>This is NOT a hiker blog.</strong><br>
                    So here's a story about me hiking.</p>

                <p>One of the first times I decided hiking sucked was going down from San Jacinto. It's a massive, dry
                    descent down from a beautiful mountain, towards the desert floor.</p>

                <p>The day before, I was atop my first real mountain, with snow and a great view. This day, all I could
                    see was the desert floor, with a huge interstate crossing it. It looked like a scar across the world
                    and so far below me. And for mile after mile, I walked towards that road. It's downhill all day, so
                    after a while my knees felt horrible. But there was still more downhill to go.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../Photos/Desert/View-of-jacinto-2.jpg" alt="View of san Jacinto" class="image-medium">
                    <figcaption>Thats where I walked down from</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>And the sun was scorching. Oh, did anyone tell you that the desert has no trees?<br>
                    Well, that's actually wrong, but this section definitely doesn't. No shade as far as my eyes could
                    see.</p>

                <p>As I'm almost limping down this hill, my water runs almost completely out. All my friends are far
                    ahead of me, and water even further. There's no way I can make it to our planned camping spot, where
                    the life giving water is, before night. I hated it, like "fuck me, why am I doing this?" All
                    memories of yesterday's glorious summit were lost, and all I wanted to do was lay down and sleep.
                </p>

                        class="image-medium">
                    <figcaption>Thats the same view all day going down.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I was hot, thirsty, and my ego was slightly bruised being so far behind everyone else. Right there I
                    decided hiking is not for me. Not in a "I want to go home" way, more in a "this is not what I saw on
                    YouTube" way. I did not feel enlightened at all yet. Just tired. But water was pushing me forward,
                    so I kept walking.</p>

                <p>And as I walked alone, with several miles to go and the sun setting, I met a guy. This tall man with
                    a beard called out to me from the bushes and asked if I had enough water.</p>

                <p>"No, I don't," I answered, thinking this could push me to my planned camp.</p>

                <p>We got to talking, and after some stiff English, we figured out we were both Swedes! Amazing!<br>
                    Then this tall, bearded countryman offered me more water—and to camp with him!</p>

                <p>Of course, as a humble Swedish man, I said, "No sir, I can't drink your precious water all
                    night."<br>
                    He insisted, and showed me something that would seal the deal.</p>

                <p>This man had brought snus. Proper Swedish snus.<br>
                    So I joined his camp, obviously. (We do love snus in Sweden.)</p>

                <p>So, cowboy camping under the stars with my new friend, I decided hiking isn't that bad after all.</p>
