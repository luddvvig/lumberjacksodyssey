            <h2>I Think I'm Dumb</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published: July 2025</p>

            <p>After having walked for 3 months the first time, I felt kinda done. I'd walked far, seen a lot, and
                wanted to sleep in a bed for consecutive nights.</p>

            <p>It took me almost 2 years to forget all the horrors of walking, and want to go back out there.</p>

            <p>The second time I felt like I could have walked for longer. Coming home to my bed still felt like a
                present for champions though. But the urge to head back out struck after just a few months. Am I going
                senile? I hate walking. I hate the rain, and the food, and overheating or freezing.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>I just realised I probably won't be able to hike a long trail next season, and I'm sitting here sad about
                it. Why though? Idiot am I? There must be something else about it that makes the suffering worth it.</p>

            <h3>So what do I like?</h3>
            <p>I hate walking but I think I love hiking.</p>

            <p>Waking up at a new place almost everyday. Walking as far as I want, or as far as the water lets me.
                Eating when I'm hungry and taking a dump in the woods when I need to. I love the personal freedom.</p>

                <figcaption>This is freedom!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I'm not spending a single braincell thinking about bills being late, cleaning the windows or what my boss
                thinks about me. I think about the next hamburger in town, when I can drink water again and where to
                sleep.</p>

            <p>I think I love the challenge. See how hard I can push myself, how far can I walk in one day? How fast can
                I walk up that hill? How many miles can I do in a week?</p>

                <figcaption>Iwalked up that. And down.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I think I love the culture on trail as well. Everyone is friendly, because they all understand your
                suffering. Getting a hitch into town right before the bar closes so you can make last call is heaven,
                and sitting around a campfire getting to know the other idiots out there and hearing how they suffered
                today is fun (even without the beers).</p>

            <p>If I could only do the fun stuff I would never stop. But maybe that's the point? You have to earn it
                first.</p>
